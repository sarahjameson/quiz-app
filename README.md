## UX Experience

    - I want to understand the site and its purpose
    - I want to view the different capabailties of the site immediately and not be overwhelmed

    - I want a simple to use site that doesn't take away from the activity. Otherwise, I would get sick of clicking on unecessary things

### Wireframe
I used wireframes to start my planning process
* Mobile, Tablet, and Desktop wireframes are all available [here](assets/wireframes).

### Design

* Colour Scheme
    - For this quiz app, I didn't want to overcomplicate things so selected three colours from [the Adobe website](https://color.adobe.com/explore). The colours were the following:
    * #F20587
    * #aaa
    * #13171D

* Typography
    - I used Google fonts for the copy
    - I used Rubik for the logo. It is a fun, modern and trendy font. It shocks the senses in pink and slanted.
    - Poppins was used for the all the other writing. It is a fun, modern and stylish font which adds to the appearance of the page. It is easy to read and doesn't overcomplate the sensory experience.

## Features

* Header
    - The header is at the top of the pages
    - The logo is positioned at the top and is visible on all pages
    - There are links to direct to the page's different sections
    - There is a hover effect and the mouse changes when hovered to indicate that it can be clicked
* Main
    - The game is the main area's focus
* Landing page
    - Gives clear options through two buttons
    - The buttons are in the middle of the page and give two options. The focus on the buttons gives a sense of excitment. What will happen if I click game? What questions will I get this time?
* Future Features
    - It would be nice to make the game more customisable with the options to have specific categories and difficulty levels
